## 👋 Hi, I’m Pradeesh
I’m a Software Engineer (backend) who enjoys building, reliable systems — the kind that quietly run in production for years.

I care about:
- distributed systems
- coordination & leases
- failure modes more than happy paths
- APIs that age well
I prefer clarity over cleverness and predictability over magic.
